Health is a state of physical, mental, and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent. Good health involves regular physical activity, balanced nutrition, adequate rest, and mental stability.

Preventive healthcare includes measures such as vaccinations, regular screenings, and healthy lifestyle choices to prevent diseases.

Chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension can often be managed or prevented through diet, exercise, and regular medical check-ups.
