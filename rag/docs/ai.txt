Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (acquiring information), reasoning (applying rules), and self-correction.

There are two main types of AI: narrow AI (designed for a specific task like voice assistants) and general AI (theoretical systems that can perform any intellectual task a human can).

Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
